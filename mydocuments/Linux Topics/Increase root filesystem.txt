Go to trubleshooting 


reboot 
==> press e 
==> ctrl+c 
==> Now you are in grub mode write (exit) 
===> you can select any mode troubleshooting,resue mode or install os

Select troubleshooting
now select continue option
now you in sh>
fdisk -l    to check the partition
lsblk   to check the free partition
create  pv of free partition
add pv into that vg where root lv built    using pvcreate pv1 /dev/sdc1   <-- for eg.
extend vg          using vgextend vgname pvpath(dev/sdc1)   <--  for eg.
now you can check vg space      using   vgs

Now you extend the root partition means extend the root lv.
So first we check the PE means Physical extents by using       vgdisplay 
in the last 2nd or 3rd line you will find 

free pe / size   so in the lvextend time you will write (+pe) value instead the size of disk.
it is most important:--

Now by using    lvextend -l +pevalue pathoflv -r        {-r means resizes the filesystem too}

exit         

now it will take some time and you system will reboot.
